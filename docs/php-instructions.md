# How to install PHP for basic use

So later on we are going to use a full LAMP stack and I'm not sure where that will be installed. But for now, we can install PHP directly on our computers and use the built-in PHP local server to test our code.

## Steps
### 1. Download PHP Binaries

- Go to https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.4
- Select the x64 thread safe option (or x86 if you have an x86 computer)
- Download the ZIP.
- Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (recommended is to put it in `C:\php`).

### 2. Add PHP to Your PATH

This makes it easier to run PHP from any command prompt location.

* Search for "_environment variables_"** in the Windows search bar.
* Click "_Edit the system environment variables._"
* Click "_Environment Variables..._"
* In the "_System variables_" section, find the "_Path_" variable and click "_Edit._"
* Click "_New_" and add the path to the PHP folder you extracted (probably `C:\php`).

Now OK your way out. You shouldnâ€™t need to reboot, but you may need to close and restart any cmd terminals you have open.

### 3. Check if PHP is working

Open a terminal and run the command:
```
php -v
```
If it displays version information, the installation was successful and your OS knows where to find it!

### 4. Configure VS Code for PHP

When you first try to open test.php in VS Code, it will probably complain and ask you to add the path to the executable. So follow their prompts, and add the line `"php.validate.executablePath": "C:/php/php.exe"` to your main VS Code `settings.json`.

### 5. Test with the Built-in Web Server

Open a terminal and navigate to the `code/` folder.

- Run 
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
- Go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser.
- You should see "Hello, world!" displayed (because `/` looks for the `index.php` file by default)
- Press `Ctrl + c` in the terminal to stop the server.
