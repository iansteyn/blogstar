# Git practices
Ian's personal Git cheat sheet: [git_tips.md gist](https://gist.github.com/iansteyn/abf4cb875b7022e46fa13b363f3753a1)

- remember to pull main before you branch!
- 1 issue, 1 branch - approximately
- commit frequently with short, descriptive commit messages
- try to do 1 commit to 1 file if possible
- push before you close your computer
- Reviews are required before a branch can be merged to main
- branch naming convetion: `branch-name`

# coding name conventions
## CSS
- class/id names: `class-name`
- name it something useful - BEM convention

## HTML
- 2 spaces indent
- Indent your html
- use semantic tags

## JavaScript
- java conventions? - camelCase

## General
- Header comments for all files (except html and css)
- comment sources for code if you get it from somewhere
- try to name things well instead of just commenting what they do
  - good comments are used sparingly, and describe *why* something is a certain way
