        <p>
          Our site is a personal blogging website, where you can create and read longform text posts. There's lots of different ways to find posts: search by keyword, and check out what's popular, and save your favorites! You can also engage with other bloggers by browsing their profiles and commenting on their posts.

          This site was created as a term project for COSC 360 - Web Programming. We have learned a great deal in the process, and are very proud of what we have built.
